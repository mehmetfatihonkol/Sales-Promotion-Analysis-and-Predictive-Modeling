# Sales Promotion Impact Analysis

## Description
This project aims to analyze the impact of sales promotions on product and store performance using historical sales data. The analysis includes clustering products and stores, measuring sales increase during promotions, evaluating promotion reaction of stores, identifying factors explaining sales change, and comparing promotion impacts between different item and store categories.
